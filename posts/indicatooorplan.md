I, like so many, have become fascinated with trading in the past few years. Partially due to the *literally* endless flow of money from the governments has caused a meteoric rise in prices of stocks, crypto, and pretty much everything else. 

That being said, we seem to be collectively coming down off the high that was rampant Quantitative Easing measures to lessen the devastating effects of the pandemic, and a return to somewhat normality in markets; meaning my **HODL** tactics will sadly need an adjustment to ensure that I don't give back everything I gained.

Unfortunately I'm no longer at University and actually have a job to do, I don't really have the time anymore to sit and stare at charts all day. So I thought, I can combine two of my biggest passions: coding and trading, to automate this process!

Enter **Indicatooor**.

## Yet Another Automated Trading Bot?

I know, I know, you're probably thinking why do I need to bother with yet another automated trading bot when there are already so many on the market that have been vigorously tested and proved themselves for years on end. To which I answer... I don't really have an answer.

This is more of a project for me to better understand algorithmic trading and how to create one from zero to one. The issue I've found with a lot of these bots is that:

* You either pay a lot to use them (not fun)
* Too complicated for my small brain to follow
* **THEY DONT SUPPORT BYBIT**

Sorry for shouting on the last one, but it is irritating that so many places seem not to support the ByBit exchange, which is my primary choice.

My main priority are the first two bullet points, I want to make an open source, free software that anyone can run, with little to no coding experience.


## What is Indicatooor?

In summary, Indicatooor will be a CLI bot that reads strategies based off technical indicators created in YAML files, to be used for backtesting or live automated trades in an exchange.

I really want to drive forward the idea of this being a pretty much code-free tool that almost anyone will be able to use, other than some tinkering with YAML files.

Now obviously, as goes for my own trading, indicators are simply there to add confluence to a trade idea gauged from price action, but some indicators can have a very good win/loss ratio isolated. This is why algorithmic trading bots exist, no human emotions, just execute if the conditions are right.

## So What Next?

Well... I'd like to provide monthly updates on how it's going, so I'm going to stick to a one month update schedule, and hopefully, I'm going to have an *incredibly* basic MVP ready by April 1st (not a joke). With a much more detailed plan of action with a fancy Trello board and such. I look forward for you joining me on this journey as I fumble my way through the land of algorithmic trading.
